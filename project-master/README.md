# Project master

An attempt to revive an old idea: a small program which allows
me to view and organize all my (old) project folders scattered all
over the disk.

Start projects, review code, fiddle with it a bit, review history.

Some concepts that me be processed in this program:
- Git Master: webbased control of git repositories originated from univas.
- Plush-markdown: A hybrid between parsed markdown and vue to create 
                  interactive experiences of documentation.
