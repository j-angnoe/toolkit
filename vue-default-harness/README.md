# Vue-default-harness

This default harness is the foundation on which I build my prototypes
and tools. It contains a collection of functions, scripts and components
that are most often used.

## Contents
- Vue
- Vue-router
- Axios (for xmlhttp/ajax interactions with server)

- Vue Goodies:
    - vue-blocks (for allowing components and url-components to be defined inside html)
    - vue dialog (for popups)
    - vue ctrl-s directive (for handling the control-s)
    - vue focus directive
    - vue link-to-storage (easily link local vue component variables to sessionStorage or localStorage)
    - vue v-tab directive (for insertion of tab characters, usually for coding tools)
    - vue ui-suggest (an autosuggest input)

- PHP Goodies:
    - pr (printing data wrapped in pre)
    - dd (dump and die)
    - firstval (get the first value of an array)
    - makeNested 
    - supernest
    - preg_grep_keys
    - amask (apply a mask to an array (i.e. return only certain keys or remove certain keys))
    - ymdtotime (return Y-m-d for given timestamp/date)
    - ymdtointerval
